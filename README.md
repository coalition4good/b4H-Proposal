Proposal 1: Community Currencies

A proposal to define implementation models for community currencies will let us explore, analize and design implementation models that facilitate the creation of communities' own currencies. 

The model contains 3 parts:

a) Community Profiles:

  This defines the criteria and identifies variences between communities that could facilitate the implmentation of CICs. The profiles will show the details and specifics of different communities in 3 different parts of the world. 

b) Community Economic development: 

  In this section, the research will take us to identify potential economic models that will support the implementations of CICs. This will help build collaterized reserves and allow for the community to learn the effects of trading, chasing out and buying into the currency.

c) Implemnetation Plan: 

  The final piece of the study is a comprehensive open source implementation plan that will serve as a guide for any community to use. The implemengtation plan aims to facilitate the technology deplayment while looking at the social, cultural and economics aspects of the implementation.
